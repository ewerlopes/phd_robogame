    "Let's use the Flappy-bird game as a simple environment. [Isaksen et al. 2015](http://game.engineering.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/exploring-game-space-FDG2015.pdf) used such game in order to show how to use Survival Analysis to explore game space. In order to anchor our research, we use essentially the same difficulty space proposed by the authors, but imposing a slight change on some parameters as well as crossing out others."
