In this framework, learning a model of players’ activity is relevant both to understand their engagement, as well as to understand specific strategies they adopted, which in turn can foster game adaptation. Following such directions and given the lack of quantitative methods for player modeling in PIRG, we propose a methodology for representing players as a mixture of existing player’s types uncovered from data. This is done by dealing both with the intrinsic uncertainty associated with the setting and with the agent necessity to act in real time to support the game interaction. Our methodology first focuses on encoding time series data generated from player-robot interaction into images, in particular Gramian angular field images, to represent continuous data. To these, we apply latent Dirichlet allocation to summarize the player’s motion style as a probabilistic mixture of different styles discovered from data. This approach has been tested in a dataset collected from a real, physical robot game, where activity patterns are extracted by using a custom three-axis accelerometer sensor module. The obtained results suggest that the proposed system is able to provide a robust description for the player interaction.},

	abstract = {Today's game analytics systems are powered by event logs, which reveal information about what players are doing but offer little insight about the types of gameplay that games foster. Moreover, the concept of gameplay itself is difficult to define and quantify. In this paper, we show that analyzing players' controller inputs using probabilistic topic models allows game developers to describe the types of gameplay – or action – in games in a quantitative way. More specifically, developers can discover the types of action that a game fosters and the extent that each game level fosters each type of action, all in an unsupervised manner. They can use this information to verify that their levels feature the appropriate style of gameplay and to recommend levels with gameplay that is similar to levels that players like. We begin with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the simplest topic model, then develop the player-gameplay action (PGA) model to make the same types of discoveries about gameplay in a way that is independent of each player's play style. We train a player recognition system on the PGA model's output to verify that its discoveries about gameplay are in fact independent of each player's play style. The system recognizes players with over 90\% accuracy in about 20 seconds of playtime.},

We present a method for unsupervised learning of common human movements and activities on an autonomous mobile robot, which generalises and improves on recent results. Our framework encodes multiple qualitative abstractions of RGBD video from human observations and does not require external temporal segmentation. Analogously to information retrieval in text corpora, each human detection is modelled as a random mixture of latent topics. A generative probabilistic technique is used to recover topic distributions over an auto-generated vocabulary of discrete, qualitative spatio-temporal code words. We show that the emergent categories align well with human activities as interpreted by a human. This is a particularly challenging task on a mobile robot due to the varying camera viewpoints which lead to incomplete, partial and occluded human detections.},

The imputation MSE on test data is reduced by 12.18\%-48.02\% when compared to using the raw data.

Under the Robot Operating System (ROS) the information generated by laser scanners can be conveyed by either LaserScan messages or in the form of PointClouds. Many publicly available algorithms (mapping, localization, navigation, etc.) rely on LaserScan messages, yet a tool for handling multiple lasers, merging their measurements, or to generate generic LaserScan messages from PointClouds, is not available. This report describes two tools, in the form of ROS nodes, which we release as open source under the BSD license, which allow to either merge multiple single-plane laser scans or to generate virtual laser scans from a point cloud. A short tutorial, along with the main advantages and limitations of these tools are presented.},

The challenges each of these factors present to the effective design of virtual environments and systematic approaches to the resolution of each of these issues are discussed.},

Our approach has been tested on a dataset collected from a real, physical robot game, where activity patterns extracted by a custom 3-axis accelerometer sensor module and by the Microsoft Kinect sensor are used. The proposed model design aims at inspiring approaches that can consider the activity of a human player in lively games against robots and foster the design of robotic adaptive behavior capable of supporting her/his engagement in such type of games.},

	volume = {23},
	abstract = {The amount of information contained in a piece of data can be measured by the effect this data has on its observer. Fundamentally, this effect is to transform the observer's prior beliefs into posterior beliefs, according to Bayes theorem. Thus the amount of information can be measured in a natural way by the distance (relative entropy) between the prior and posterior distributions of the observer over the available space of hypotheses. This facet of information, termed ”surprise”, is important in dynamic situations where beliefs change, in particular during learning and adaptation. Surprise can often be computed analytically, for instance in the case of distributions from the exponential family, or it can be numerically approximated. During sequential Bayesian learning, surprise decreases as the inverse of the number of training examples. Theoretical properties of surprise are discussed, in particular how it differs and complements Shannon's definition of information. A computer vision neural network architecture is then presented capable of computing surprise over images and video stimuli. Hypothesizing that surprising data ought to attract natural or artificial attention systems, the output of this architecture is used in a psychophysical experiment to analyze human eye movements in the presence of natural video stimuli. Surprise is found to yield robust performance at predicting human gaze (ROC-like ordinal dominance score of 0.7 compared to 0.8 for human inter-observer repeatability, 0.6 for simpler intensity contrast- based predictor, and 0.5 for chance). The resulting theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio- temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

In this contribution, we describe results of an exploratory study in which we investigated relationships between players’ performance and their subjective assessment of difﬁculty and fun. We tested ﬁve different algorithms that, instead of adjusting game speed, adjust difﬁculty by choosing blocks based on the current game state. With our results, we establish pile height and bumpiness as parameters that indicate the performance of a player during a live game, discuss the inherent difﬁculty of different block choosing algorithms and show how the relationship between fun and perceived difﬁculty varies for distinct player groups. With regard to adapting difﬁculty, we argue that one can still teach an old dog such a TETRIS a lot of new tricks.},
