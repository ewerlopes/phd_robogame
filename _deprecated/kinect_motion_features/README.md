# Kinect Motion Features

Software for motion feature extraction from Kinect v2 on Windows. However, the KinectFeatures API has been designed not to depend on a particular library for the skeleton tracking with Kinect. In this way, you can easily use this code on `Linux`, provided that you can extract the skeleton joint position using any available library.

## Requirements

* A system to perform skeleton tracking (Microsoft Kinect SDK 1.8+).

## Features

Features can correspond to a specific joint (e.g. velocity of right hand) or general body movement
(e.g. quantity of motion). They can be extracted from more than one skeleton. The current list of features is:

### Joint features

* Position / filtered position
* Velocity (3D)
* Velocity magnitude (speed)
* Velocity magnitude (speed) mean
* Acceleration (3D)
* Acceleration magnitude
* Acceleration magnitude mean
* Acceleration along the trajectory of movement
* Acceleration along the trajectory of movement mean
* Distance to torso
* Relative position to torso (3D) (goes from -1 to 1 along all 3 axes, calculated relative to user's height)

### Overall descriptors

* **Quantity Of Motion:** Mean of all joint velocity values (scaled by a factor of 30 in order to ease visualization).
* **Contraction Index:** Empirically defined at the [creator's paper](http://nime2014.org/proceedings/papers/464_paper.pdf).
* **Fluidity:** Mean of all joint acceleraion values (scaled by a factor of 10 in order to ease visualization).

## Credits
This piece of code was originally desined by the Music Technology Group - Universitat Pompeu Fabra / Escola Superior de M�sica de Catalunya. Specifically, it was created and maintained by Álvaro Sarasua, in the github repository:  <https://github.com/asarasua/ofxKinectFeatures>, being an application strongly dependent on OpenFrameworks.

In this repository, the code has been modified to fit the research developed  at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AIRLab) at Politecnico di Milano (Milano-Italy) under the purpose of my PhD research. **The main difference in this code version is that it doesn't depend on OpenFramework anymore and it includes `fluidity` as a new descriptor.**

## How to use it
KinectFeatures code was designed to only compute descriptors from motion capture data. To track the skeleton from a Kinect device, linking to the Microsoft Kinect SDK or any other framework is need.

To link properly, using the Kinect SDK using Visual Studio 2012+, do:

1. Create a new Project Property sheet.
2. Add "$(KINECTSDK20_DIR)\inc" value to Project Property -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories.
3. Add "$(KINECTSDK20_DIR)\lib\x64" (or x86, depending on your system) value to Project Property -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Additional Library Directories.
4. Add "Kinect20.lib" value to Project Property -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies.

**If you are using Kinect One, change the environment variable accordingly.**

`IN THE PRESENT CODE I USE OPENCV FOR DRAWING THE SKELETON OVER THE RGB DATA, AS WELL AS VISUALIZE THE DEPTH DATA. THE SKELETON.CPP CLASS IS THE MAIN OBJECT FROM WHICH THE KINECTFEATURE OBJECT IS CREATED AND CALLED. YOU CAN DEFINE YOUR OWN MAIN CLASS AND REMOVE THE DEPENDENCE ON OPENCV, IF YOU WILL.`

##API
The API has been designed not to depend on a particular library for the skeleton tracking with Kinect.

The features are accessed through an `KinectFeatures` object, so declare it in your main:

```cpp
KinectFeatures featExtractor;
```

If you wish to extract features for more than one skeleton, just declare one KinectFeatures object for each (e.g. by creating a `map<int,KinectFeatures>` where keys correspond to an skeleton id).

In setup(), it is necessary to tell KinectFeatures which indices correspond to the **head** and **torso** joints, as some calculations need to know about this. This is easily done depending on the libray being used for skeleton tracking.

```cpp
featExtractor.setup(JointType_Head, JointType_SpineMid); //Using Kinect SDK 2.0
```

In `update()`, just update skeletons data sending a `map<int, ofPoint>` where keys are integers identifying joints and values are the x, y, z positions of these joints. Here is the general idea in pseudocode:

```cpp
if tackedUsers {
    user = getTrackedUser();
    map<int, ofPoint> joints; // a joint "dictionary"
    for all joints{
        joints[j] = user.getJointPosition();
    }
    featExtractor.update(joints); //update the feature measures
}
```

*Look inside `Skeleton::skeletonTracking()` in this repository code in order to now more.*

With the correct update loop, features can be accessed calling the appropriate methods.

In order to get the x velocity of the right hand, for instance, using the Kinect SDK 2.0:

```cpp
if skeletonExists {
    featExtractor.getVelocity(JointType_HandRight).x;
}
```

For overall descriptors, just call the corresponding method. E.g.:
```cpp
    featExtractor.getQom();
```
